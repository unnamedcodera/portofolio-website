## üí° Tips

1. **Save your token:** After login, save the JWT token for subsequent requests
2. **Check response status:** 200 = success, 401 = unauthorized, 404 = not found, 500 = server error
3. **Verify in browser:** After API changes, refresh frontend to see updates
4. **Database changes:** Directly reflected in the frontend
5. **CORS:** If you get CORS errors, check backend/.env CORS_ORIGIN setting

---

## üêõ Common Issues

**401 Unauthorized:**
- Token expired (login again)
- Token missing or malformed
- Wrong Authorization header format

**404 Not Found:**
- Resource doesn't exist
- Wrong ID
- Wrong endpoint URL

**500 Internal Server Error:**
- Check backend terminal for error details
- Database connection issues
- Invalid data format

---

## üìù Notes

- All endpoints return JSON
- Timestamps are in UTC
- IDs are auto-incremented integers
- display_order determines sort order (lower = first)
- is_active (for slides) and is_featured (for projects) are boolean (0 or 1)

Happy Testing! üöÄ
